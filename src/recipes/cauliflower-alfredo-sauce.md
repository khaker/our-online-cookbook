**Cauliflower Alfredo Sauce Recipe:**

* Put all ingredients into a medium pot and bring to a complete boil, then cover and simmer 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is fall-apart tender.

* Pulverize with either an immersion or regular blender.

* Serve over pasta, or spaghetti squash, rice, roasted vegetables, or whatever you wish. Makes about 2 cups, and it gets much thicker as it sits.
